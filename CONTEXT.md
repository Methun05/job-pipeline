# Job Pipeline — Project Context for Reviewers & AI Agents

> Read this before touching any code. This project is live and runs daily.

---

## Why this exists

Job hunting manually is slow. This pipeline automates two specific strategies for a **Product Designer (5 years exp, crypto/web3 UX)** looking for remote roles:

1. **Proactive outreach** — Find companies the moment they get funded (warm money = active hiring). Reach out before they post a job.
2. **Passive monitoring** — Watch all major crypto job boards daily and surface only the relevant design roles.

It runs every day at **8 AM IST** and results appear at **https://tracker.methun.design**.

---

## Track A — Funded Companies

**Source**: CryptoRank scraper only (free, scrapes Next.js SSR data — no paid API).

**What we filter in:**
- Funding amount: **$1M – $50M** (too small = no design team yet, too large = already fully staffed)
- Round types: **Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A, Series B** only (later rounds = harder to get in early)
- Date window: **last 45 days** — older than that, the moment has passed

**What we extract:**
- Company name, website, LinkedIn, funding amount + round type, announced date
- **Contact person** — the right person to reach out to, based on company size:
  - Small (<20 employees): CEO / Co-Founder / CTO
  - Mid (20–50 employees): CPO / Chief Product Officer / Head of Product
  - Large (50+): Head of Design / Design Manager
- Contact's name, title, LinkedIn URL, Twitter handle (for cold outreach)
- Email is **not extracted in the pipeline** — costs Apollo credits. Revealed on-demand from dashboard.

**Gemini generates** (per company): a company summary, LinkedIn note, email subject + body.

---

## Track B — Job Postings

**Sources (10 total):**
- web3career (scraper — /design-jobs page, no API key)
- cryptojobslist (RSS)
- cryptocurrencyjobs (RSS)
- dragonfly (scraper — Getro platform, jobs.dragonfly.xyz)
- arbitrum (scraper — Getro platform, jobs.arbitrum.io)
- hashtagweb3 (scraper — hashtagweb3.com, JSON-LD schema, 260+ listings)
- talentweb3 (recruiter aggregator — skip contact search for this source)
- solana_jobs (scraper — Getro platform, jobs.solana.com)
- paradigm (scraper — paradigm.xyz/jobs, 600+ portfolio company jobs, has salary data)
- sui_jobs (scraper — Getro platform, jobs.sui.io)

**Getro platform pattern** (dragonfly, arbitrum, solana_jobs, sui_jobs):
- All use `__NEXT_DATA__` SSR → `props.pageProps.initialState.jobs.found`
- `url` field is a direct job URL on Solana/Sui boards
- `organization.websiteUrl` may not exist on all Getro boards

**Paradigm board specifics:**
- `__NEXT_DATA__` → `props.pageProps.jobs` (different path from Getro)
- Has structured salary: `{minValue, maxValue, currency}` in USD
- `createdAt` is ISO string, `remote` is boolean, `locations` is array

**Filtering — in this order:**

1. **Role keyword match** — title must contain: product designer, UX designer, UI/UX, interaction designer, visual designer, etc. Everything else is dropped immediately.

2. **Experience level** — parsed from job description + title:
   - `skip` — hard skip: staff/principal/director/VP keywords, or 7+ years required
   - `stretch` — 5–6 years required (shown but flagged)
   - `strong` — 0–4 years required (ideal match)
   - `ambiguous` — no clear signal → Gemini classifies it

3. **Remote scope detection**:
   - `us_only` — explicit US restriction keywords → flagged
   - `global` — worldwide/fully remote/anywhere keywords
   - `unclear` — "remote" with no qualifier → Gemini classifies it

4. **Dedup** — URL exact match first (fastest), then company+title fuzzy match within 30-day window (catches same job relisted with a different URL)

**Gemini extracts** (per job): `requirements_bullets` (3 bullets), `candidate_location`, and optionally `experience_match` / `remote_scope` when rule-based classification is ambiguous.

> **Key**: Before calling Gemini, the pipeline fetches the actual `job_url` page (3000 chars) using `fetch_website_text(url, max_chars=3000)`. This gives Gemini the real job posting instead of the partial/tag-only scraped `description_raw`. Falls back to `description_raw` if page fetch fails or returns less text.

**`candidate_location`** — what Gemini extracts from the real job page:
- Where the **candidate must be**, not the company HQ
- Examples: `"Remote – worldwide"`, `"San Francisco, CA (onsite)"`, `"Remote – US only"`, `"Not specified"`
- Stored as `description_summary.candidate_location` in the DB (JSON field)
- Shown in jobs **table Location column** (replaces scraped value, falls back to scraped if null/"Not specified")
- Shown as **amber card** at top of Requirements tab on job detail page

Cover letter and email draft are **not** generated in the pipeline — generated on-demand via Chat tab in dashboard.

**Contact finding** — same Apollo → Hunter chain as Track A. Skip contact search for `talentweb3` (recruiter aggregator).

## Critical rules — DO NOT break these

### 1. Never touch `.env`
All API keys live in `.env` locally and in GitHub Actions secrets. Never commit real keys to git. `.gitignore` already blocks `.env`.

### 2. `GEMINI_ENABLED` flag in `config.py`
```python
GEMINI_ENABLED = True   # ← currently True (dual-key fallback in place)
```
If Gemini is disabled, AI-generated content is skipped — that's intentional. Don't remove the `if GEMINI_ENABLED:` guards.

### 3. `cryptorank_scraper.py` is the ONLY Track A source
RSS sources were removed because they need Gemini to parse. Do not add new RSS sources to Track A unless Gemini is enabled and tested.

### 4. Apollo API
- People search (`/api/v1/mixed_people/api_search`): free, no credits.
- **Email reveal (`/v1/people/match`): costs 1 credit** — only called from dashboard "Find Email" button, never from the pipeline
- Never call `apollo.reveal_email()` in bulk or in automated loops
- The old endpoint `/v1/mixed_people/search` is deprecated (returns 422) — do not revert to it

### 5. Dedup logic is critical
`pipeline/dedup/matcher.py` uses fuzzy matching (RapidFuzz, threshold=85). Don't change the threshold without testing.

### 6. DB schema
Never modify Supabase tables directly without a migration file in `supabase/migrations/`. The dashboard reads specific column names — renaming columns will break the UI.

### 7. Run command
```bash
python3 -m pipeline.main   # use system python3, NOT venv (venv is py3.14 — incompatible)
```

### 8. exa-py version pin
```
exa-py>=1.14.0,<2.0.0   # DO NOT upgrade to 2.x — requires openai, conflicts with google-genai
```

### 9. Track B query is locked
Dashboard always filters `.eq("track", "B")` — never remove this filter.

  ├── Check Apollo credits
  ├── Load all existing companies (for dedup)
  ├── Track A:

## Enrichment stack

All enrichment runs for **both Track A and Track B**.

### Contact finding
```
Apollo /mixed_people/api_search (free, no credits)
  ↓ returns None OR throws error
Hunter.io domain-search (free, 25 searches/mo)
```
Hunter fallback triggers on **both** "no result" and Apollo API errors.

### Twitter handle
```
Exa key1 ──(quota error)──▶ Exa key2
    └── no result found ──▶ Tavily ──▶ Brave Search
```

### Company LinkedIn
```
Exa key1 ──(quota error)──▶ Exa key2
    └── no result found ──▶ Tavily ──▶ Hunter /companies/find
```

### Email reveal (on-demand from dashboard only)
```
1. Apollo /people/match (costs 1 credit — needs apollo_person_id)
   ↓ no email or no credits
2. Hunter email-finder with LinkedIn profile URL
   ↓ no email
3. Hunter email-finder with name + domain
   ↓ no email
4. Exa — scan company website pages for email matching domain
```

### Gemini content generation
```
Gemini key1 ──(daily quota exhausted)──▶ Gemini key2
```

> **Fallback philosophy**: Key rotation (key1→key2) happens on quota/errors — same data, extra quota. Source fallback (Exa→Tavily→Brave) happens when previous source finds nothing — different indexes, different coverage.

## Dashboard features

### Jobs table (Track B)
- Location column shows **Gemini `candidate_location`** (where candidate must be) — falls back to scraped `job.location` for old records without it
- Filter by application/outreach status
- Company column: Globe (website) + LinkedIn icons
- Source labels: Web3.career, CryptoJobsList, Dragonfly, Arbitrum, #Web3, TalentWeb3, Solana Jobs, Paradigm, Sui Jobs

### Job detail page (`/jobs/[id]`)
- **Requirements tab**:
  - Amber card at top: "Where You'd Need to Be" — Gemini's `candidate_location`
  - Location + Salary cards (if present)
  - 3 key requirements bullets
  - "✨ Analyze Job Posting" button — triggers on-demand Gemini analysis (also extracts `candidate_location`)
- **Chat tab**: Live Gemini chat with job context auto-injected. Supports image/PDF upload. Use this for cover letters, LinkedIn notes, email drafts.

### Funded companies table (Track A)
- Click row → navigates to `/funded/[id]` detail page
- Detail page: Company Overview tab (type, funding, investors, country) + Chat tab
- Company description intentionally removed from the table (visible in overview tab)
- Find Email button on detail page (Apollo → Hunter 4-step chain)

### Shared
- "Find Email" button — Apollo credit first, falls back to Hunter (4-step chain)
- Twitter icon: blue = high confidence, yellow = unverified
- Fixed left sidebar: Funded Companies + Job Postings tabs

---

## description_summary JSON schema

Stored as JSON string in `job_postings.description_summary`. All fields optional/nullable:

```json
{
  "location": "city or remote info from description",
  "salary": "salary range string or null",
  "requirements": ["bullet 1", "bullet 2", "bullet 3"],
  "candidate_location": "Remote – worldwide | San Francisco, CA (onsite) | Not specified | ..."
}
```

`candidate_location` is populated by both:
- Pipeline (via `generate_job_content` with `job_page_text`)
- On-demand dashboard button (`/api/generate-content` → `generate_summary` action)

## What's safe to work on

- Dashboard UI changes (components, styling, layout)
- Adding new Track B fetchers (job board scrapers)
- Improving filters in `pipeline/filters/`
- Fixing bugs in existing fetchers
- Adding new enrichment sources to the cascading chain

## What needs extra care

- `pipeline/db.py` — any change here affects all data writes
- `pipeline/dedup/matcher.py` — changing this could cause duplicate records
- `pipeline/apollo.py` — API credits are limited
- `pipeline/enrichment/exa_finder.py` — Exa key pool logic, don't break rotation
- `dashboard/app/funded/page.tsx` and `jobs/page.tsx` — these query Supabase directly
- Any DB schema change — needs migration file + dashboard update together

---

## Known bugs fixed (Mar 15 2026)

### React error #31 on funded company detail page (`/funded/[id]`)
**Symptom:** Clicking any company card in Track A crashed with "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {key, name})".

**Root cause:** CryptoRank's API returns several fields as objects, not plain strings. Old records in Supabase stored these raw objects:
- `raw_data.funds` → stored as `[{key: "a16z", name: "Andreessen Horowitz"}, ...]` (not `["Andreessen Horowitz", ...]`)
- `raw_data.country` → stored as `{key: "us", name: "United States"}` (not `"United States"`)
- `raw_data.company_type` → added defensive guard (Gemini sets this as a string, but guard prevents future regressions)

**Fix:**
1. `dashboard/app/funded/[id]/page.tsx` — `funds` rendering uses `typeof fund === "string" ? fund : fund.name`. `country` rendering uses same pattern. `companyType` extracted defensively.
2. `dashboard/components/FundedCompanyCard.tsx` — `company_type` rendering in both mobile card + desktop row guarded against object values.
3. `pipeline/fetchers/cryptorank_scraper.py` — `country` now extracted as `c.get("name") if isinstance(c, dict) else c` so future records store plain strings.

**Lesson:** When scraping CryptoRank's `__NEXT_DATA__`, assume any field can be a `{key, name}` object. Always extract `.get("name")` defensively for string fields.

**Mistake in first fix attempt:** Only fixed `funds`, missed `country`. Second deploy still crashed because `raw_data.country` was also an object for old records. Always audit ALL `raw_data` field renders together.

---

## Testing lessons — mistakes made (Mar 16 2026)

### Mistake 1: Unit tests with mocks cannot catch missing CI env vars

**What happened:** GitHub Actions workflow was missing env vars for GEMINI_API_KEY_2, EXA_API_KEY, EXA_API_KEY_2, TAVILY_API_KEY, HUNTER_API_KEY. Pipeline ran daily without the full enrichment chain. All Twitter/LinkedIn lookups fell through to Brave (worst source) silently.

**Why Claude missed it:** Unit tests used `mock.patch` to replace API clients entirely. Mocks pretend keys exist and calls succeed — they never touch `os.getenv()`. Tests passed locally (where `.env` has all keys) but CI never had those keys.

**How to avoid this — if writing tests again:**
1. **Always include an env var smoke test** — before any mocked test, assert that required keys are non-empty strings in the real environment:
   ```python
   def test_required_env_vars_present():
       import os
       required = ["EXA_API_KEY", "TAVILY_API_KEY", "HUNTER_API_KEY", "GEMINI_API_KEY", "GEMINI_API_KEY_2"]
       for key in required:
           assert os.getenv(key), f"Missing required env var: {key}"
   ```
2. **Cross-check workflow file against config.py** — every key loaded via `os.getenv()` in `config.py` must have a corresponding `${{ secrets.KEY_NAME }}` line in `.github/workflows/daily_pipeline.yml`. This is the single most important CI audit step.
3. **Write at least one integration test per enrichment chain** — not mocked, uses real API keys, verifies the full Exa→Tavily→Brave cascade works end-to-end in CI.
4. **After adding any new API key** — immediately update the workflow file. Don't defer it.

**Symptoms of this bug:** Pipeline runs show `errors: []` and `status: completed` but enrichment data (Twitter, LinkedIn, contacts) is missing or low quality. Records save fine — only enrichment is silently degraded.

---

### Mistake 2: CryptoRank stage filter dropping most valid companies

**What happened:** CryptoRank's `__NEXT_DATA__` SSR payload returns `stage: null` for ~75% of funding rounds. The scraper's stage filter (`STAGE_MAP.get(stage_raw)`) dropped any round without a recognized stage. Result: out of 20 rounds fetched, 15+ were dropped. Only 3 passed, and all 3 were already in the DB → `Track A new: 0` every day.

**Root cause discovered Mar 16 2026** by running the scraper live and printing all 20 rounds with drop reasons.

**Fix applied:** Stage filter made optional — null/unmapped stage now stored as `"Unknown"` instead of causing a hard drop. Amount filter ($1M–$50M) is the primary filter. Stage is metadata only.

**Also discovered:** CryptoRank `fallbackRounds.total = 10,883` but SSR only returns 20 per page. Pagination was added (see scraper for current implementation).

## Deferred / future work

- Gmail response tracking — monitor inbox, auto-update outreach status when replies come in
- Re-add RSS sources to Track A (TechCrunch, EU Startups etc) when ready
- Salary + visa sponsorship extraction in pipeline Gemini prompt (fields exist in DB, never populated by pipeline — only by on-demand dashboard button)
